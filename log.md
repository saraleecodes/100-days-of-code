# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Decided on a goal & looked up similar projects to provide inspiration.

**Thoughts:** I AM INTIMIDATED. But these are just meant to serve as inspiration and references when I get stuck in the code. I think I'll be able to make at least a simple visualizer in 100 days, and I can iterate on that if there's time left.

### Day 1: September 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100-days-of-code repository & explored its contents. Re-familiarized myself with the Github workflow. Examined the source code of the webcam audio visualizer & compared with my broken code from Codevember 2018. Created a progress log.

**Thoughts**: I want to make a webcam audio visualizer of some kind, but I also want to differentiate it from the demo. Perhaps I can change the shapes or maybe add effects to the video itself (ghost image, etc). I wonder if I can build a link-to-video feature where the user can make a visualizer out of any video on YouTube.

### Day 2: September 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Installed a webcam on my desktop. Cloned the webcam-audio-visualizer repository into a local directory & installed all dependencies. Tweaked individual settings in index2.js to familiarize myself with the code & see what I could change about the output without adding new functions. Changed the colors to represent the non-binary pride flag and changed the music to my newest song draft.

**Thoughts**: Realized that I didn't have a desktop webcam, so I installed DroidCam to connect my phone as a webcam. It worked really well! The possibilities of merging this visualizer with my own music and dance performance is really, really exciting!!! I LOVE AUDIO VISUALIZERS!!!

### Day 3: September 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Forked & cloned the webmidi-threejs repository. Spent most of the hour trying to figure out how to interface it with the Webcam Audio Visualizer, but was not successful. Increased the view distance on the visualizer so more of the particles could be seen.

**Thoughts**: My partner suggested the exciting idea of allowing midi input with the Webcam Audio Visualizer, but it may be more complex of a problem than I can solve at the moment. I'm going to put that idea on the backburner for now. Tomorrow, I'll focus on changing the visuals from a particle to something more smooth (or a different geometry).

### Day 4: September 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Unsuccessful attempt to change the particle effect to a wireframe effect. Looked up other shader materials in the Three.js documentation.

**Thoughts**: A family emergency delayed this update by a few hours. My head's just not in it today. I think I need to build a wireframe (or other geometry) audio visualizer first, then go through the tutorial to implement webcam input. Working with the existing code has been informative, but I think I'm trying to skip too many steps without learning the foundations.
