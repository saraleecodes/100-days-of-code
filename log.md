# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Decided on a goal & looked up similar projects to provide inspiration.

**Thoughts:** I AM INTIMIDATED. But these are just meant to serve as inspiration and references when I get stuck in the code. I think I'll be able to make at least a simple visualizer in 100 days, and I can iterate on that if there's time left.

### Day 1: September 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100-days-of-code repository & explored its contents. Re-familiarized myself with the Github workflow. Examined the source code of the webcam audio visualizer & compared with my broken code from Codevember 2018.

**Thoughts**: I want to make a webcam audio visualizer of some kind, but I also want to differentiate it from the demo. Perhaps I can change the shapes or maybe add effects to the video itself (ghost image, etc). I wonder if I can build a link-to-video feature where the user can make a visualizer out of any video on YouTube.
